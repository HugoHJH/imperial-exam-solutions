### 1 ai)

SYN is a control bit in a TCP header.

Transport Layer.

### 1 a ii)

When a signal decreases in strength over distance.

note: Repeater solves this

Physical Layer.

### 1 a iii)

A way of encoding a signal by using a clock for synchronization between receiver and sender.

Every binary value is represented by presence or absence of transitions. 

Physical Layer.

### 1 a iv)

Routing strategy that uses dynamic routing.

Each router creates a table with all of its neighbours in the network and updates their distances dynamically.

Network Layer.

### 1 a v)

SFD is part of Ethernet frames IEE802.3 . Header then a delimeter. It allows the receiver to synchronize with the frame even if it misses the start of the preamble. It is usuall 101011.

Data Link Layer.

### 1 a vi)

You use it when you are 'pinging'.

When you 'ping' you send an echo response packet to verify a path works and end host is present.

It allows routers to send control error messages to other routers' hosts.

Network Layer.

### 1 b i)

In data communications, flow control is the process of managing the rate of data transmission between two nodes to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver.

### 1 b ii)

TCP implements flow control with a sliding window size.

This works by using sequence, acknowledgement and window fields of the TCP header. Recipient shoudl not send more than (window sizw - bytes sent).


### 1 b iii)

### 1 b iv)

### 2 a i)

Sharing a medium.

### 2 a ii)

TDM - Time Division Multiplexing. Divide the channel into fixed time slots and encode signals to be sent at different times.

FDM - Frequency Division Multiplexing. Think of radio AM/FM frequencies.

CDMA - Code Division Multiplexing. Everyone talking but in different languages. 

### 2  a iii)

In the transport layer, many packets exist destined for different ports. 

### 2 b i)

An IP address serves two principal functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing.

Media access control address (MAC address), also called physical address, is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment. 

### 2 b ii)

1. Class from the IP (B) 
2. Host occupies 16 bits
3. Network occupies 14 bits

### 2 b iii)

ARP.

### 2 b iv)

Default Router: 225 should be 247 because it has to be the same address 1.

DNS Server 1: 192 is a private address and can't be made public.

Can't have non consecutive 1's in a netmask.
