Transparent Spanning Tree Bridges use Backwards Learning to build a table of hosts and links. 

It does this by reading the destination and source addresses of the frames. Over time, all hosts should send frames and therefore it creates a complete table of hosts and links for every bridge.

Backward learning allows bridges to operate transparently tot he network hosts who need not be aware of their existence.

Backwards learning is related to the Data Link Layer.

ARP - Address Resolution Protocol

ARP is a way to ask for IP/data link address mappings for LAN

```
If host A has no entry for host B,

A will broadcast an ARP address - requesting data link address for B's IP

B recognizes its IP address - returns ARP response with its data link address

B also caches A's data link/ IP address mapping
```

ARP relates to the network layer.
