Transparent Spanning Tree Bridges use Backwards Learning to build a table of hosts and links. 

It does this by reading the destination and source addresses of the frames. Over time, all hosts should send frames and therefore it creates a complete table of hosts and links for every bridge.

Backwards learning is related to the Data Link Layer.
