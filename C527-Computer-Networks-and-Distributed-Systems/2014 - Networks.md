ICMP - allows routers to send control/error messages to other routers/hosts and provide feedback about communication problems (e.g. no guarantee of delivery, control message return) 

For general knowledge:

- ICMP
  - Internet Control Message Protocol - messages which generally contain information about routing difficulties with IP datagrams or simple exchanges such as time-stamp or echo transactions.

- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol 
  - provides Internet hosts with configuration parameters. DHCP is an extension of BOOTP. DHCP consists of two components: a protocol for delivering host-specific configuration parameters from a DHCP server to a host and a mechanism for allocation of network addresses to hosts. 

- Address Resolution Protocol / Reverse Address Resolution Protocol 
  - to initialize the use of Internet addressing on an Ethernet or other network that uses its own media access control (MAC). ARP allows a host to communicate with other hosts when only the Internet address of its neighbors is known. Before using IP, the host sends a broadcast ARP request containing the Internet address of the desired destination system. 


ICMP relates to the Network Layer of the OSI Model.

### a ii)

Frame delimiter - indicate start/end of frame (protocol data unit of the data link layer). Comes after the preamble in the ethernet packet. 

Preamble: establish synchronization


### a iii)

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocal used by Mail Transfer Agents (e.g. Exchange) and Mail User Agents (Outlook, Thunderbird) for delivering mail from one system to another.

two parties communicate using TCP and port 25.

SMTP relates to the application layer.



#### a iv)

Routing table - lists routes and distance to particular network destinations. (Every computer that runs TCP/IP makes routing decisions that are determined by the IP routing table.)




1b i) 
Medium Access Control - Sublayer of the data link layer. It provides addressing mechanism and channel access so each node can communicate with other nodes on the same or other networks. Supports multiplexing.
