What Are The Advantages Of POP?
Being the original protocol, POP follows the simplistic idea that only one client requires access to mail on the server and that mails are best stored locally. This leads to the following advantages:

- Mail stored locally, i.e. always accessible, even without internet connection
- Internet connection needed only for sending and receiving mail
- Saves server storage space
- Option to leave copy of mail on server
- Consolidate multiple email accounts and servers into one inbox

Circuit 

- Fixed bandwidth
- Unused bandwidth wasted
- Call set-up required
- Congestion may occur at call set-up (arrival rate = transmission rate)
- Overhead on call setup only
- In-order delivery
- Circuit fails if any link or switch fails

Packet Switching

- Variable bandwidth
- Uses only bandwidth required
- No call set-up
- Congestion may occur on any packet (causing delay and reordering)
- Overhead on every packet
- Out-of-order delivery
- New route found if any link or switch fails (some data
may be lost)
