i.

Sign and Magnitude: just flip the sign for negatives 

10101101

ii.

One's complement: invert all digits

11010010

iii. 

Two's complement: invert all digits and add one

11010011

iv.

Excess-K: start from base of K, 1K is 0. 

00101101

###b.

High order interleave is when modules are addressed far apart and 
Low order interleave is when modules are addressed contiguously.

High order interleave if you want modules to be accessed independently 
by different units, e.g. by the CPU and a Hard Disk (or a second CPU) AND 
the units use different Modules.

Low order interleave is good if the CPU (or other unit) needs to request
multiple adjacent memory locations.

###c.

NOR:

| A | B |   |
|---|:-:|--:|
| T | T | F |
| F | T | F |
| T | F | F |
| F | F | T |

i. A NOR A --> 'A

ii.

1. Convert to binary number
2. Normalise
3. Find Significand
4. Find Exponent


1. -52.3 => 1001010.01001100011..
2. 1.001010010011 x 2^6
3. 0100 1010 0100 1100 0110 0011
3. 6 + 127 = 133 => 1000 0101
4. sign exponent significand => 1 10000101 0100 1010 0100 1100 0110 0011

Hex => 1854A4C63

i.

OPCODE

ii.

By variable: Rm, Addr

By index: Rm, [Rn]

By address: Rm, 0x00F3

By address is the quickest because there is no conversion and lookup.
