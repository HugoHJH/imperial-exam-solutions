i.

Sign and Magnitude: just flip the sign for negatives 

10101101

ii.

One's complement: invert all digits

11010010

iii. 

Two's complement: invert all digits and add one

11010011

iv.

Excess-K: start from base of K, 1K is 0. 

11111111- 11010010=00101101

Different Answer:
I wonder if I'm doing this one wrong but I did -45 + 64 = 19.
64 is the offset (excess-64), -45 is the number we want.
So we do the binary of 19... 00010011.  Please advise? :/

###b.

High order interleave is when modules are addressed far apart and 
Low order interleave is when modules are addressed contiguously.

High order interleave if you want modules to be accessed independently 
by different units, e.g. by the CPU and a Hard Disk (or a second CPU) AND 
the units use different Modules.

Low order interleave is good if the CPU (or other unit) needs to request
multiple adjacent memory locations.

1. Convert to binary number

-52.3 => 100 1010.0100 1100 011.. 

2. Normalise

1.0010 1001 0011 x 2^6            

3. Find Significand


4. Find Exponent

Convert to binary number: 11 0100.0100 1100 11...

Normalize: 1.1010 0010 0110 011.. x 2^5

Significand field (23 bits): 1101 0001 0011 0011 0011 001

Exponent field (5+127 = 132): 1000 0100

Sign: 1 

Final Soltuion:

Sign,Exponent,Significand

1 1000 0100 110100010011001100110

i.

OPCODE

ii.

By variable: Rm, Addr

By index: Rm, [Rn]

By address: Rm, 0x00F3

By address is the quickest because there is no conversion and lookup. 

iii.

High level solution:
```
while Memory[address] == 0
  address += 1
  
```


iv.

A jump instruction will change the program counter to continue execution at a different part of the program.

A call instruction will push the current program location (or current location + 1) to the call stack and jump to another part of a program. A return instruction will then pop the location off of the call stack and jump back to the original location (or orignal location + 1).

So, a jump instruction is close to a GOTO, while a call instruction is close to a procedural/function call.
