###a.

i.

Sign and Magnitude: just flip the sign for negatives 

10101101

ii.

One's complement: invert all digits

11010010

iii. 

Two's complement: invert all digits and add one

11010011

iv.

Excess-K: start from base of K, 1K is 0. 

11111111- 11010010=00101101

###b.

High order interleave is when modules are addressed far apart and 
Low order interleave is when modules are addressed contiguously.

High order interleave if you want modules to be accessed independently 
by different units, e.g. by the CPU and a Hard Disk (or a second CPU) AND 
the units use different Modules.

Low order interleave is good if the CPU (or other unit) needs to request
multiple adjacent memory locations.

1. Convert to binary number

-52.3 => 1001010.01001100011..

2. Normalise

1.001010010011 x 2^6

3. Find Significand


4. Find Exponent

Convert to binary number: 110100.0100110011...

Normalize: 1.101000100110011.. x 2^5

Significand field (23 bits): 110100010011001100110

Exponent field (5+127 = 132): 1000 0100

Sign: 1 

Final Soltuion:

Sign,Exponent,Significand

1 1000 0100 110100010011001100110

i.

OPCODE

ii.

By variable: Rm, Addr

By index: Rm, [Rn]

By address: Rm, 0x00F3

By address is the quickest because there is no conversion and lookup.
