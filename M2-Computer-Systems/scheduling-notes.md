Preemptive Vs Nonpreemptive Scheduling

The Scheduling algorithms can be divided into two catagories with respect to how they deal with clock interrupts.

Nonpreemptive Scheduling

A scheduling discipline is nonpreemptive if, once a process has been given the CPU, the CPU cannot be taken away from that process.

Following are some characteristics of nonpreemptive scheduling

    In nonpreemptive system, short jobs are made to wait by longer jobs but the overall treatment of all processes is fair.
    In nonpreemptive system, response times are more predictable because incoming high priority jobs can not displace waiting jobs.
    In nonpreemptive scheduling, a schedular executes jobs in the following two situations.
        When a process switches from running state to the waiting state.
        When a process terminates.

Preemptive Scheduling

A scheduling decipline is preemptive if, once a process has been given the CPU can taken away.

The strategy of allowing processes that are logically runable to be temporarily suspended is called Preemptive Scheduling and it is contrast to the "run to completion" method.

 
Scheduling Algorithms

CPU Scheduling deals with the problem of deciding which of the processes in the ready queue is to be allocated the CPU.

Following are some scheduling algorithms we will study

    FCFS Scheduling.
    Round Robin Scheduling.
    SJF Scheduling.
     SRT Scheduling.
    Priority Scheduling.
    Multilevel Queue Scheduling.
