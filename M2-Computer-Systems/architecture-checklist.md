Sign and Magnitude
- find the positive binary and, if negative, flip the sign (first bit).

One's Complement 
- find positive binary and, if negative, flip all of the bits.

Two's Complement
- same as one's complement but if negative, add one to the one's complement.

Excess-64
  - 64 is the offset (excess-64), say -45 is the number we want so we'll do the binary of 19.
