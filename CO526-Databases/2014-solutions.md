```
S = {
  ABGH  -> BC,
  B     -> BDEF,
  C     -> H,
  E     -> D,
  F     -> BD,
  G     -> AB
  }
  
```

Compute the minimum cover Sc of S

1. Rewrite S to an equivalent set of FDs which only have a single attribute on the RHS of each FD:

```
S' = {
  ABGH  -> B,
  ABGH  -> C,
  B     -> B,
  B     -> D,
  B     -> E,
  B     -> F,
  C     -> H,
  E     -> D,
  F     -> B,
  F     -> D,
  G     -> A,
  G     -> B
  }
```
