# mcs-revision

Past exam solutions and tutorials for Msc. Computing at Imperial College.

This is very much a work in progress and any additions and corrections are welcome. 

### how to make corrections and/or contributions

1. make a github account (duh)

2. raise an issue and link to the exam where the mistake is (check out the example issue near the top of your screen)

3. fork the imperial-exam-solutions (this basically means make your own copy of it)

4. on your own fork of the repository, make the correction and then make a pull request leaving a comment stating which issue you've fixed

or you could fb message me your github username and i'll add you as a collaborator :D
